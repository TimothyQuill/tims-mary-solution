The document is a large legal text with many detailed objections and responses.\n3. The query is very specific and requires precise extraction of objections related to scope, privilege, and relevance.\n4. Traditional keyword search (full_text_search) might retrieve many irrelevant or partial results because legal objections can be phrased in various ways.\n5.

The query is fact-specific and requires precise retrieval of detailed evidence and witness testimony from Mr. Depp’s declaration.\n2. The document contains a large amount of text, including legal procedural content, interrogatories, and declarations.\n3. Keyword-based search (full_text_search) can quickly locate mentions of \"evidence,\" \"witness,\" \"testimony,\" \"declaration,\" \"Mr. Depp,\" \"Ms. Heard,\" and related terms.\n4. However, the user’s query is complex and semantic in nature, involving understanding the context of Mr. Depp’s counterarguments and the types of evidence he cites.\n5. A vector_search (semantic embedding) would help capture the meaning and context beyond exact keywords, especially to find passages where Mr. Depp discusses evidence and witnesses, even if the exact keywords differ.\n6.
